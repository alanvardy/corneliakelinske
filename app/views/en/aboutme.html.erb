            I am a translator/interpreter with both in-house and freelance experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hold a German degree (equivalent to M.A.) in conference interpreting from the Faculty of Translation Studies,
            Linguistics and Cultural Studies of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, a faculty highly regarded in the
            translating/interpreting world.

            After graduating, I worked for over 2 years as a translator and occasional interpreter for the Federal Office of
            Languages, the language service of the German military. During this time, I gathered translating experience in
            numerous
            fields of expertise including military and defence related topics, technical translations (technical
            specifications,
            operating manuals, interpreting for tank operating courses) and legal documents (MoUs, service agreements,
            procurement
            contracts). At the same time, I worked as a sworn court interpreter and volunteered as an interpreter and
            translator
            for two non-profit organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2011 I moved to Edmonton, Alberta, and have been working as a freelancer ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a certified translator for the language combinations English into German and German into English, a member of
            the
            Association of Translators and Interpreters of Alberta (<%= link_to 'ATIA', 'https://atia.ab.ca', target: '_blank' %>) and, by affiliation, of the Canadian Translators,
            Terminologists and Interpreters Council (<%= link_to 'CTTIC', 'http://www.cttic.org/mission.asp', target: '_blank' %>).
