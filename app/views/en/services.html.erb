<p></p>I take great pride in my work so you can be assured that providing quality services is always my priority.
<p></p>Irrespective of what kind of project you entrust me with, this is what I offer:
<p>
    <h4>
        Quality from one source:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            I am the person translating your document or the interpreter you will be working with
        </li>
        <li>
            Unless explicitly agreed otherwise, I am the only person working on your project
        </li>
        <li>
            Any questions that arise during the project can be clarified directly between the client (you) and the
            translator/interpreter (me)
        </li>
        <li>
            I can provide a high level of reliability: Deadlines agreed on will be met.*
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h4>
        Individual treatment for all projects:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your projects are important to me
        </li>
        <li>
            Each project will be assessed individually to determine appropriate rates and deadlines
        </li>
        <li>
            Your preferences (e.g. terminology, style etc.) will be respected
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h4>
        You pay for your desired outcome:
    </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You only pay the person performing the service you requested, i.e. me
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no additional cost component paid to third parties for the management of your project
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
