I offer professional translation and interpretation services at a competitive rate.
Prices depend on a number of different factors. Please find out more by clicking on the service you require or contact
me to obtain a free and non-binding quote.
I take great pride in my work so you can be assured that providing quality services is always my priority.
Irrespective of what kind of project you entrust me with, this is what I offer:
Quality from one source:
I am the person translating your document or the interpreter you will be working with
Unless explicitly agreed otherwise, I am the only person working on your project
Any questions that arise during the project can be clarified directly between the client (you) and the
translator/interpreter (me)
I can provide a high level of reliability: Deadlines agreed on will be met.*
Individual treatment for all projects:
Your projects are important to me
Each project will be assessed individually to determine appropriate rates and deadlines
Your preferences (e.g. terminology, style etc.) will be respected
You pay for your desired outcome:
You only pay the person performing the service you requested, i.e. me
There is no additional cost component paid to third parties for the management of your project
*Unless a force majeure, sudden illness or accident occurs, in which case I will notify you and make best efforts to
find a replacement
