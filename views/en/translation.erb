Translation
As a professional translator, I always translate your text as a whole.
This means I take into account the context, the style and the readers the text is addressed to.
Thus, the outcome will not be a mere agglomeration of individual words, translated on a word by word basis, but an
integral target-language text, tailored to your needs and readership.
Areas of expertise
Over the years, I have gained experience in translating documents in a large variety of fields.
My main areas of expertise are:
Legal (e.g. contracts, MoUs, patent litigation documents)
Technical (e.g. user manuals, patent applications)
Military (everything from procurement related documents to OP orders)
Marketing (e.g. website content, newsletters, advertisement)
I have also translated some more extraordinary texts such as the tour program for a choir, including all the lyrics of
their songs, or a book interpreting one of the books of the Bible.
I am always interested in learning new things and am happy to familiarize myself with new topics.
Prices
I usually charge for my translations on a per-word basis (source word count for word documents, target word count for
PDFs).
The rate will be determined on the basis of the following factors:
Word count
Text type
Formatting requirements
Deadline
Please contact me to obtain a free and non-binding quote for the document you would like to have translated. It goes
without saying that I will keep all your documents confidential.
Certified translations
I provide certified translations for both my language combinations, English -> German and German -> English.
