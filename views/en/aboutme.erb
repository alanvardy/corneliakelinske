About Me
I am a translator/interpreter with both in-house and freelance experience.
I hold a German degree (equivalent to M.A.) in conference interpreting from the Faculty of Translation Studies,
Linguistics and Cultural Studies of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, a faculty highly regarded in the
translating/interpreting world.
After graduating, I worked for over 2 years as a translator and occasional interpreter for the Federal Office of
Languages, the language service of the German military. During this time, I gathered translating experience in numerous
fields of expertise including military and defence related topics, technical translations (technical specifications,
operating manuals, interpreting for tank operating courses) and legal documents (MoUs, service agreements, procurement
contracts). At the same time, I worked as a sworn court interpreter and volunteered as an interpreter and translator
for two non-profit organizations.
I moved to Edmonton, Alberta in 2011 and am now able to focus fully on my freelance career, specializing mainly in
legal, technical and marketing translations.
I am a certified translator for the language combinations English into German and German into English, a member of the
Association of Translators and Interpreters of Alberta (ATIA) and, by affiliation, of the Canadian Translators,
Terminologists and Interpreters Council (CTTIC).
